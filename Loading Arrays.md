To load arrays from files, use the `np.load()` function. This function reads the `.npy` files created by `np.save()` and reconstructs the original array. For instance, `array = np.load('array_file.npy')` loads the array stored in `array_file.npy` back into the variable `array`. This functionality ensures that you can seamlessly access and work with your data across different sessions or share it with others.
Load a NumPy array from a file:

````python
a_loaded = np.load('array.npy')
````
