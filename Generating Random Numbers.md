NumPy's `np.random` module offers a variety of functions to generate random numbers. For instance, `np.random.rand()` produces random floating-point numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Similarly, `np.random.randn()` generates random numbers from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1). These functions are useful for creating random samples and initializing algorithms with random values.

Create an array of random numbers:

````python
random_array = np.random.rand(3, 3)
````
