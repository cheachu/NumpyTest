NumPy also supports exponential and logarithmic functions:

* **`np.exp()`**: Calculates the exponential of each element, e^x.
* **`np.log()`**: Computes the natural logarithm (base e) of each element.
* **`np.log10()`**: Computes the base-10 logarithm.
* **`np.log2()`**: Computes the base-2 logarithm

Apply exponential and logarithmic functions to array elements:

````python
exp_vals = np.exp(a)  # Exponential
log_vals = np.log(a)  # Natural logarithm
````
