* Slicing in NumPy allows you to select a subset of elements from an array efficiently. For example, if you have a 2D array `b`, you can use slicing to extract a portion of it. By specifying a range of indices for each dimension, such as `b[0:2, 1:3]`, you can select a subarray.
* In this case, `b[0:2, 1:3]` extracts a 2x2 subarray consisting of rows 0 and 1, and columns 1 and 2 from the original array. Slicing is a powerful feature that helps in manipulating and analyzing specific portions of your data without altering the original array.

Select a subset of elements from an array:

````python
subset = b[0:2, 1:3]  # Select a 2x2 subarray
````
