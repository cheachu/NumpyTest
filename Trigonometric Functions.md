NumPy provides a variety of trigonometric functions that operate element-wise on arrays. These include:

* **`np.sin()`**: Computes the sine of each element.
* **`np.cos()`**: Computes the cosine of each element.
* **`np.tan()`**: Computes the tangent of each element.
* **`np.arcsin()`, `np.arccos()`, `np.arctan()`**: Compute the inverse trigonometric functions.

These functions are essential for tasks involving angle measurements, rotations, and oscillatory phenomena.

Perform trigonometric operations on array elements:

````python
sin_vals = np.sin(a)
cos_vals = np.cos(a)
tan_vals = np.tan(a)
````
