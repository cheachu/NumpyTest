* You can transpose the dimensions of an array in NumPy using functions like `np.transpose()`. 
* This operation swaps the rows and columns of a 2D array (or more generally, permutes the axes of an array). 
* For instance, if you have a 2D array `b`, applying `np.transpose(b)` will flip its dimensions, converting rows into columns and vice versa. 
* This is useful for changing the orientation of your data or preparing it for certain operations that require a different dimensional arrangement.

Transpose the dimensions of an array:

````python
d = np.transpose(b)
````
