NumPy provides robust tools for generating random numbers and arrays, which are crucial for simulations, statistical sampling, and stochastic processes. Hereâ€™s how you can use these features:

### [Generating Random Numbers](Generating%20Random%20Numbers.md)

### [Random Integers](Random%20Integers.md)

These random number generation tools are essential for a wide range of applications, from statistical modeling to machine learning and beyond.
