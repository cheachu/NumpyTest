* In NumPy, you can create an array filled with zeros using the `np.zeros()` function. This function allows you to specify the desired shape of the array.
* For instance, you can create a 1D array with a specific number of zeros or a 2D array (matrix) with a defined number of rows and columns, all filled with zeros. 
* This is particularly useful for initializing data structures or matrices where you need a baseline value of zero before populating or performing further computations.

To create an array of zeros with a specified shape:

````python
zeros = np.zeros((2, 3))
````
