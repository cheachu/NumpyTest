To install NumPy, you can use Python's package manager, pip. Simply open your terminal or command prompt and run the command:

````python
pip install numpy
````

This will download and install the latest version of NumPy along with any necessary dependencies. If you're using a Jupyter notebook or another interactive environment, you might need to restart the kernel after installation to begin using NumPy.
