The matrix inverse is a crucial operation where you find a matrix that, when multiplied with the original matrix, results in the identity matrix. In NumPy, you can compute the inverse of a matrix using the `np.linalg.inv()` function. This operation is vital for solving systems of linear equations and various matrix-related computations.

Calculate the inverse of a matrix:

````python
inv_matrix = np.linalg.inv(identity)
````
