To access specific elements in a NumPy array, you use indexing. For example, if you have a NumPy array `a`, you can retrieve individual elements by specifying their indices. For instance, `a[1]` accesses the element at index 1, which is the second element in a zero-based index system. This straightforward indexing technique allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data within arrays. For multi-dimensional arrays, you specify indices for each dimension, such as `a[2, 3]` to access an element in the third row and fourth column.
Access specific elements in a NumPy array:

````python
element = a[1]  # Access the second element
````
