To generate random integers, you can use functions like `np.random.randint()`. This function allows you to specify the range of integers and the shape of the array you want to create. For example, `np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(3, 3))` generates a 3x3 array with random integers between 0 and 9. This capability is useful for tasks like generating test data or simulating random events.
Generate random integers within a specified range:

````python
rand_ints = np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))
````
