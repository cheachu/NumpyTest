* To create an array filled with ones in NumPy, you use the `np.ones()` function. This function generates an array where every element is set to one. 
* You can specify the shape of the array, allowing you to create arrays of different dimensions.
* For example, you might create a 1D array with a specified number of ones or a 2D array with a defined number of rows and columns.
* Arrays of ones are often used for initialization purposes, in algorithms where a starting value of one is needed, or for constructing identity matrices.
  To create an array of ones with a specified shape:

````python
ones = np.ones((2, 3))
````
