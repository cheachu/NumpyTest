An array is a powerful, multi-dimensional data structure used to store and manipulate numerical data. Known as `ndarray`, it is a homogeneous container, meaning all elements must be of the same type, such as integers or floats. This uniformity allows for efficient storage and computation. Arrays can be one-dimensional, like a simple list of values, or multi-dimensional, like matrices or higher-dimensional tensors.

The key features of NumPy arrays include:

1. **Efficiency**: Arrays are implemented for performance, enabling fast and memory-efficient operations compared to Python's built-in lists.
1. **Vectorization**: NumPy supports vectorized operations, allowing you to perform mathematical operations on entire arrays simultaneously, avoiding the need for explicit loops.
1. **Shape and Dimensions**: Arrays have a shape (the number of elements along each dimension) and dimensionality (the number of dimensions), which can be easily queried and modified.
1. **Broadcasting**: This feature allows arrays of different shapes to be used together in operations by automatically expanding the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array.
   There are types of arrays in NumPy.
